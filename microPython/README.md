### MicroPython for the micro:bit robots

These robots take in a sequence in moves, directions forward, backward, left turn, and right turn. The robots each move based on 360-degree, continuous servo motors. The robot is balanced on a 12mm steel ball. Much of the initial robot is based on the [ring:bit from Elecfreaks](https://www.elecfreaks.com/learn-en/microbitKit/ring_bit_v2/ring-bit-python.html).

This code uses the micro:bit as all input/output for the robot. The robot will take in one sequence of moves
